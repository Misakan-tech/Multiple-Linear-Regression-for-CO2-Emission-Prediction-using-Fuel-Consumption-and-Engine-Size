# Multiple-Linear-Regression-for-CO2-Emission-Prediction-using-Fuel-Consumption-and-Engine-Size
This program builds a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict COâ‚‚ emissions using engine size and fuel consumption. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, standardization, model training, and visualization using scatter plots and a 3D regression plane to analyze predictions effectively.
